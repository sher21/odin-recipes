# Odin Recipes

## First Half of the assignment:

We are creating a recipes homepage. No extra decoration, just homepage with a link to subpage.In the homepage, we learnt on how to redirect link to another page, optionally open a blank page while doing that. We also learnt to keep the link in an unordered list to make the link in one column.

For subpage, we created 3 pages for recipes. To ease our coding, we get the picture from the allrecipes.com as well as the recipes. 

There are lasagna, hotdog_roll and orange_chicken page that we create. For each page, we learnt on how to add picture to our page, setting the height and width. We also learnt on how to add unordered list for the ingredients and ordered list for the steps. Note that the difference between both list is unordered list comes with bullet point while ordered list comes with number. 

We also learnt on how to add paragraph as well as different heading. There are 6 heading but for our page, we only include 2 heading which is h1 and h3(for subtopic). Last, we also add the link to direct us to our homepage. (The link will not open to new tab since we are not redirecting it to new tab.)

In summary, what we learnt:
* adding relative and absolute link 
* redirect link to open in a new tab
* handle different heading (got 6 heading)
* add simple paragraph
* add unordered list (comes in bullet point)
* add ordered list (comes in numbers)
* add image and adjust the height and width.

Note: We did not add any text manipulation like strong, em, italic or bold. We also did not experiment with other heading except for h1 and h3.
